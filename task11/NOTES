# Discovery

List all modules with `lsmod`.

Find a device under /sys/devices, and then locate the matching driver.

> Every directory under /sys/devices that contains a file called "uevent" represents a device.

find /sys/devices -name uevent

I'm choosing /sys/devices/platform/pcspkr (./drivers/input/misc/pcspkr.c)

> A device is simply any data structure that contains an embedded struct device, no more and no less.

# Building

```
cd /usr/src/linux-source-3.16
make oldconfig
make prepare
make scripts
```

Modify your module and execute the following:

``` bash
# In the directory which your patched module is
make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules
# Then install with
make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules_install
```

# Failures

Welp, this didn't work for the pcspkr device because it already defines an attribute called `id`.

I'm attempting to modify the driver for a WiFI USB adapter I have which uses the Realtek 8187.

## vermagic failures:

I ran into a bunch of issues trying to compile the modules using all of the documentation I was reading.

There's something about the way we're compiling rtl8187 as an external modules (with M=$(pwd)) which just
doesn't quite jive with the includes style which they're using in the local Makefile.

I was able to get around this issue (as you can see in the Vagrantfile) by just symlinking the drivers source
directory to the headers root so that the driver could resolve its dependency from there. It's weird, but it worked.

Here are some resources I referenced while troubleshooting that:
