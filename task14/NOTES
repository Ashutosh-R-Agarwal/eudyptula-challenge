# Task structure
The core kernel task structure is declared in include/linux/sched.h as `struct task_struct`.

# Set task id

It _looks_ like all new tasks are created within `do_fork` in kernel/fork.c

# Proc

We'll also need to edit the proc fs, which will be under fs/proc/base.c
Pid entries are added for tasks at fs/proc/base.c:2944

I think this will work:
 
 > ONE("id", S_IRUGO, proc_pid_id),

 S_IRUGO = All users can read
